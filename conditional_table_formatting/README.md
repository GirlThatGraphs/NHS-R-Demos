Conditionally formatting the cells of tables is quite a common thing that people want to do when they move from Excel to R. This folder contains (at the time of writing) two ways of doing so- one with kableExtra, and the other with gt. The kableExtra version uses discrete red/ amber/ green values, whereas the gt version gives a smooth colour gradient.
