# Making a list of Shiny UI dynamically

In a [text mining application](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/experiencesdashboard) that I have running in a few different Trusts (hoping to add more- get in touch! :wink:) I need to include or exclude tabs. I can't use conditional panel- well, I don't think I can, it makes something really ugly when I do the obvious thing with it. There doesn't seem to be an obvious simple way of doing it, so I'm going to have a go in here to build a simple example to make sure it works and then transfer it to the main project.

If you've been on my Shiny training you'll know I always emphasise starting simple, I think doing this in the full application I'm really asking for trouble, so here's me taking my own medicine and starting simple.

I'm open sourcing it here so there's a simple version of the idea others can copy :relaxed:.
