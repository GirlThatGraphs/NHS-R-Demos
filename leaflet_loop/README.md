This is an example of producing leaflet maps in a loop, with different variables summarised. AFAIK leaflet doesn't play nicely with quasiquotation so I've made a bit of a hacky solution, but it works :smiley:.

Note that the data has a completely made up column in it to illustrate the point so please ignore the actual dataset because I made a mess of it.

Note also that the use of mapview package is because the person who asked wanted a Word document- you don't need this if you're just doing HTML reporting.
